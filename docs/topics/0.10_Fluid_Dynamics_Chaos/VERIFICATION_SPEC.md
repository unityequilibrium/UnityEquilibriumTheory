# Verification Spec

- Primary command:
  - `python docs/topics/0.10_Fluid_Dynamics_Chaos/Code/02_Proof/Proof_Turbulence_Benchmarks.py`
- Inputs:
  - Benchmark grid configuration embedded in script
  - Internal comparator implementation
  - `Data/03_Research/source_lock_manifest.json`
- Reported metrics:
  - Runtime for comparator and UET solver
  - Relative speedup
  - Stability under stress test
  - machine-readable `results.status`
  - source-lock, benchmark-script, and core-equation hashes
- Current threshold:
  - `speedup > 2.0`
  - finite stress-test output
- Artifact target:
  - `Result/artifacts/fluid_benchmark_validation.json`
- Interpretation:
  - `PASS` means the implementation beat the embedded simplified comparator under this
    declared configuration and finite-output stress gate.
  - It does not establish external CFD validation or theorem-level Navier-Stokes results.

## Chaos Method Validation

- Command: `python docs/topics/0.10_Fluid_Dynamics_Chaos/Code/03_Research/Research_Chaos_Method_Validation.py`
- Artifact: `Result/artifacts/chaos_method_validation.json`
- Controls: stable linear flow, logistic map at `r=4`, and Lorenz-63.
- Primary estimator: Benettin/QR tangent evolution.
- Cross-check: periodically renormalized shadow trajectories.
- Acceptance: known sign/value controls, time-step convergence, method agreement,
  and explicit exclusion of `R_gen` and `R_obs` from dynamical state.
- Interpretation: a pass validates the internal numerical method only; it is
  independent of the speed comparator and does not establish chaos in UET.
