# 🚧 Limitation: Neutrino Mixing

## Problem Statement

### The Standard Model View
PMNS matrix describes mixing, but:
- **3 angles + 1 phase** — measured, not derived
- **δ_CP** — CP violation source unknown

### Key Question
**Why these specific mixing angles?**

---

## The Gap

1. **PMNS is empirical** — no derivation from SM
2. **Mass ordering** — Normal vs Inverted unknown
3. **Dirac vs Majorana** — nature of neutrino mass unknown
