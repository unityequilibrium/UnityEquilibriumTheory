# 🚧 Limitation: Gravity & General Relativity

## Problem Statement

### The Classical View
General Relativity (GR) succeeds spectacularly at large scales but:
- Incompatible with Quantum Mechanics
- No clear mechanism for gravity at quantum scale
- Equivalence Principle assumed, not derived

### Key Question
**Why does η = 0?** (Why is gravitational and inertial mass identical?)

## Historical Context

| Theory | Achievement | Limitation |
|:-------|:------------|:-----------|
| Newton | Universal gravitation | No explanation of mechanism |
| Einstein | GR, spacetime curvature | Incompatible with QM |
| Standard Model | QFT for 3 forces | No graviton, no gravity |

---

## The Gap

1. **Equivalence Principle is empirical** — tested to 10⁻¹⁵ but not derived
2. **No unified framework** — GR and QM remain separate
3. **Missing thermodynamic link** — Bekenstein-Hawking entropy suggests connection

---

## Necessity for UET

- Need framework where η = 0 is **derived**, not assumed
- Need gravity to emerge from **information geometry**
- Need connection to **thermodynamic principles**
