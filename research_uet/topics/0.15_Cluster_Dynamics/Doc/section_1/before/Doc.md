# 🚧 Limitation: Cluster Dynamics

## Problem Statement

### The Classical View
Galaxy clusters should follow virial equilibrium, but:
- **Missing mass** — observed velocity dispersion too high
- **Dark matter required** — undetected particles needed

### Key Question
**Why is cluster mass larger than visible matter?**

---

## The Gap

1. **Virial theorem** works, but requires unseen mass
2. **No unified explanation** with galaxy rotation curves
3. **CDM model** — ad-hoc dark matter distribution

---

## Necessity for UET

- Need cluster dynamics from **same UET equation** as galaxies
- Need dark matter effects from **information field gradients**
