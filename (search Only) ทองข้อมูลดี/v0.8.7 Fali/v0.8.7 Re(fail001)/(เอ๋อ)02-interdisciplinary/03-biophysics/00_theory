# Biophysics Theory: GDS Mapping

## 1. Domain Description

Biophysics studies physical principles in biological systems: cell movement, protein folding, neural activity.

## 2. GDS → Biophysics Mapping

### 2.1 Symbols

| GDS | Biophysics | Description |
|-----|------------|-------------|
| **Ω** | Chemical potential | Concentration field |
| **F** | Cell velocity | Migration direction |
| **∇Ω** | Concentration gradient | dC/dx |
| **λ** | Mobility | D/kT |

### 2.2 Potential Function

```
Ω(x) = -kT ln(C(x))

Where:
  C(x) = Concentration at position x
  kT = Thermal energy
```

Physical interpretation: **Chemical potential drives diffusion**

### 2.3 Force Equation (Chemotaxis)

```
v = -D ∇C / C  (drift)
  = -D ∇(ln C)
  = -(D/kT) ∇Ω
```

**Prediction:** Cells move up concentration gradients (toward attractant)

## 3. Applications

### 3.1 Chemotaxis
Bacteria (E. coli) swim toward nutrients:
- Run-and-tumble with bias
- Average motion follows gradient

### 3.2 Morphogen Gradients
Embryo development:
- Concentration patterns define cell fates
- Wolpert's "French flag" model

### 3.3 Protein Folding
Energy landscape:
- Native state = global minimum
- Folding = gradient descent on landscape

## 4. Testable Predictions

| Prediction | Test | Expected |
|------------|------|----------|
| Cells move toward attractant | Tracking | v ∝ -∇C |
| Noisy but systematic | Correlation | r < 0 |
| Speed ∝ gradient | Regression | Positive slope |
