# Econophysics Theory: GDS Mapping

## 1. Domain Description

Econophysics applies concepts from statistical physics to economic and financial systems.

## 2. GDS → Econophysics Mapping

### 2.1 Symbols

| GDS | Econophysics | Description |
|-----|--------------|-------------|
| **Ω** | Market stress | Deviation from equilibrium price |
| **F** | Returns | Log price change: r = log(P_t/P_{t-1}) |
| **∇Ω** | Stress gradient | dΩ/dt |
| **λ** | Market efficiency | Speed of price adjustment |

### 2.2 Potential Function

We define market "energy" as:

```
Ω(t) = [P(t) - MA(t)]² / σ²

Where:
  P(t) = Price at time t
  MA(t) = Moving average (20-day)
  σ = Standard deviation of prices
```

Physical interpretation: **Distance from trend, normalized by volatility**

### 2.3 Force Equation

```
F = -λ ∇Ω

Returns = -λ × d(Stress)/dt
```

**Prediction:** Prices move toward the moving average (mean reversion)

## 3. Testable Predictions

| Prediction | Test | Expected |
|------------|------|----------|
| Corr(F, ∇Ω) < 0 | Pearson correlation | Negative |
| p-value < 0.05 | Significance test | Significant |
| Power law α ≈ 3 | Tail distribution | Inverse cubic |

---

## 4. Literature Support

The "inverse cubic law" (α ≈ 3) is well-documented:
- Mandelbrot (1963): Fat tails in cotton prices
- Gopikrishnan et al. (1999): α = 3 in S&P 500
- Stanley et al. (1999): Scaling in stock markets

---

## 5. Limitations

1. Not all stocks follow mean reversion (growth stocks)
2. Market regimes change (bull vs bear)
3. VIX shows opposite behavior (fear index)
