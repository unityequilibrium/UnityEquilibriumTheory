**"Unity Equilibrium Theory: A Thermodynamic Framework for Gradient-Driven Systems"**

---

## Abstract (Draft)

```
We present Unity Equilibrium Theory (UET), a mathematical framework 
for modeling coupled systems that evolve toward equilibrium. UET 
extends the classical Cahn-Hilliard and Landau-Ginzburg formalism 
by introducing a two-field approach (C/I) with explicit coupling. 

The framework is grounded in thermodynamic principles, specifically 
the minimization of free energy through gradient flow dynamics. We 
prove that the energy functional Ω decreases monotonically (dΩ/dt ≤ 0), 
establishing Lyapunov stability for all configurations.

This paper provides the mathematical foundation, complete with proofs 
of stability, equilibrium conditions, and numerical implementation. 
UET serves as a common language for describing energy-minimizing 
dynamics across multiple domains.

Keywords: Gradient flow, Free energy, Cahn-Hilliard, Phase field, 
          Coupled systems, Lyapunov stability
