## Paper Title (Draft)

**"Cross-Domain Applications of Unity Equilibrium Theory: From Physics to Machine Learning"**

---

## Abstract (Draft)

```
Building on the theoretical foundation of Unity Equilibrium Theory 
(UET), we demonstrate its application across diverse domains: 
thermodynamics, classical mechanics, econophysics, network science, 
biophysics, and machine learning.

In each domain, we show how the universal gradient flow dynamics 
(dΩ/dt ≤ 0) maps to domain-specific phenomena. We validate UET 
predictions against real data (econophysics) and simulated systems 
(other domains).

Results show that UET provides a consistent conceptual framework 
for understanding energy-minimizing dynamics across domains. The 
C/I (Communication/Isolation) interpretation offers intuitive 
understanding while maintaining mathematical rigor.

Keywords: Cross-domain modeling, Econophysics, Network science, 
          Machine learning, Gradient flow, Complex systems
