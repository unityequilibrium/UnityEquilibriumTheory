## Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [EQUATIONS.md](./EQUATIONS.md) | Pure mathematics only |
| [INTERPRETATION.md](./INTERPRETATION.md) | What C, I, Ω mean |
| [CLAIMS.md](./CLAIMS.md) | What theory claims (honestly) |
| [LIMITATIONS.md](./LIMITATIONS.md) | What theory CANNOT do |

## Quick Summary

### The Equations
```
Ω[C,I] = ∫[ V(C) + V(I) - β·C·I + κ|∇C|² + κ|∇I|² ] dx

∂C/∂t = -M·δΩ/δC   (Gradient flow)
```

### What It Is
```
✅ Landau-Ginzburg coupled field theory
✅ Cross-domain mathematical language
✅ Educational framework
```

### What It Is NOT
```
❌ New fundamental physics
❌ Replacement for Newton/Maxwell
❌ Source of new predictions
```
