## Title
Unity Equilibrium Theory: A Thermodynamic Foundation for Fundamental Physics

## Authors

## Abstract (250 words max)
We present Unity Equilibrium Theory (UET), a thermodynamic framework that describes fundamental physics through a single gradient-flow equation. Starting from the principle that all systems evolve toward minimum free energy, we derive a unified description of gauge symmetries (U(1), SU(2)) from complex field coupling, fermion statistics from topological defects, and natural units from fixed-point parameters. The core equation governs all dynamics through energy minimization. Numerical simulations using semi-implicit spectral methods confirm energy monotonicity across 39 independent tests spanning gravity, electromagnetism, strong and weak forces, quantum mechanics, and cosmology. We provide falsifiable predictions testable in phase-separating systems. All code and data are open source.
