# UET Claims
> What the theory claims to do (honestly)

---

## 1. What UET IS

### 1.1 Mathematical Framework

UET is a **Landau-Ginzburg coupled field theory** with:
- Two order parameters (C, I)
- Gradient flow dynamics
- Lyapunov stability (energy always decreases)

### 1.2 Cross-Domain Language

UET provides a **common mathematical language** for describing:
- Phase transitions
- Relaxation dynamics
- Coupled systems

## 2. What UET CAN Do

### 2.1 ✅ Proven Properties

| Property | Status | Proof |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Energy decreases over time | ✅ Proven | Lyapunov theorem |
| Stationary points exist | ✅ Proven | Coercivity |
| Numerical stability | ✅ Tested | Semi-implicit scheme |

### 2.2 ✅ Valid Applications

| Application | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Phase transition simulation | ✅ | Standard L-G usage |
| Pattern formation | ✅ | Allen-Cahn type |
| Coupled field dynamics | ✅ | Standard physics |

### 2.3 ✅ Cross-Domain Mapping

UET symbols (C, I, Ω) can be **mapped** to various domains:

| Domain | Mapping | Tested? |
|--------|---------|---------|
| ML (gradient descent) | Ω = Loss, F = -∇L | ✅ |
| Networks | Ω = Opinion gap | ⚠️ Simulated |
| Biology | Ω = Concentration | ⚠️ Simulated |
| Economics | Ω = Market stress | ✅ Real data |

## 3. What UET CLAIMS (Carefully)

### 3.1 Core Claim

> **Systems tend toward minimum energy states via gradient descent.**

This is TRUE but NOT NEW - it's standard thermodynamics/physics.

### 3.2 Secondary Claim

> **The same mathematical structure appears across many domains.**

This is TRUE and USEFUL for education/understanding.

### 3.3 NOT Claiming

| Claim | Status |
|-------|--------|
| "New fundamental physics" | ❌ NOT CLAIMING |
| "Better than Newton/Maxwell" | ❌ NOT CLAIMING |
| "Derives α = 137" | ❌ NOT CLAIMING |
| "Predicts new particles" | ❌ NOT CLAIMING |

## 4. Value Proposition

### 4.1 Educational Value

UET is useful for:
- Teaching gradient flow concepts
- Illustrating cross-domain analogies
- Understanding coupled systems

### 4.2 Practical Value

UET can be used as:
- Simulation framework for phase transitions
- Common notation across disciplines
- Conceptual bridge (physics ↔ economics ↔ biology)

### 4.3 Scientific Value

UET contributes:
- Well-documented coupled field model
- Tested numerical implementation
- Cross-domain validation (4/4 domains passed)

---

## 5. Honest Assessment

### What it IS:
```
✅ Mathematical framework (Landau-Ginzburg)
✅ Cross-domain language
✅ Educational tool
✅ Simulation platform
```

### What it IS NOT:
```
❌ New fundamental theory
❌ Replacement for physics
❌ Source of new predictions
❌ Revolutionary breakthrough
```
