# Physics Gaps Index

This directory contains honest assessments of physics gaps in UET.

## Gap Status Summary

| Gap | Status | Severity | Notes |
|-----|--------|----------|-------|
| [Lorentz Invariance](gap_lorentz_invariance.md) | ⚠️ Acknowledged | Medium | UET is non-relativistic by design |
| [Gauge Symmetry](gap_gauge_symmetry.md) | ⚠️ Partial | Medium | U(1) done, SU(N) sketched |
| [Fermion Derivation](gap_fermion_derivation.md) | ⚠️ Proposed | High | Topology mechanism, not proof |
| [Planck Constant](gap_planck_constant.md) | ❌ Unsolved | High | ℏ remains input, not output |

## Overall Assessment

| Category | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Gaps Solved | 0/4 |
| Gaps Partially Addressed | 3/4 |
| Gaps Honestly Acknowledged | 4/4 |

**Key insight:** Being honest about limitations is MORE credible than claiming to solve everything.
