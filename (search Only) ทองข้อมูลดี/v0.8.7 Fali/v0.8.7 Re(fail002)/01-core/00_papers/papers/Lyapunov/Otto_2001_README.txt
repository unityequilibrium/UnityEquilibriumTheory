OTTO 2001 - THE GEOMETRY OF DISSIPATIVE EVOLUTION EQUATIONS
=============================================================

Felix Otto - Comm. PDE 26 (2001), 101-174

KEY CONTRIBUTION:
- Gradient flows as curves of steepest descent
- Riemannian structure of Wasserstein space
- Energy = Lyapunov functional

This is foundational for understanding UET as gradient flow!
