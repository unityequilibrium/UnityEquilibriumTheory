# 📏 The Metric Test: One Equation, All Scales

**User Request:** "Test across all scales. The theory must work everywhere, back and forth."
**Hypothesis:** The **UET Vitality Metric** ($V$) is Scale-Invariant.

---

## 1. The Universal Metric ($V$)
We define a single metric for "System Health/Value":
$$ V = \frac{\text{Connectivity (C)}}{\text{Closure (I)}} \times \text{Efficiency} $$

- **In Galaxies:** $V$ = Stability against collapse (Gravity/Dark Matter balance).
- **In Markets:** $V$ = True Value (Earnings/Volume balance).
- **In Biology:** $V$ = Vitality (Flexibility/Structure balance).
- **In Society:** $V$ = Peace (Connection/Identity balance).

## 2. The Cross-Scale Experiment
We will overlay the results from **ALL 5 Simulations** onto a single normalized graph.

### The "Golden Zone" Hypothesis
We predict that **all stable systems** exist in a specific ratio range of $C/I$.
- **Too High $C/I$:** Chaos (Bubble, Arrhythmia, Polarization, Plasma).
- **Too Low $C/I$:** Stasis (Depression, Rigidity, Dark Matter Halo, Crystal).
- **Golden Zone:** Life / Stable Galaxy / Healthy Market.

## 3. Execution Plan (`universal_metric_test.py`)
1.  **Normalize Data:** Convert results from Galaxy ($km/s$), Market ($), Bio ($ms$), AI ($Loss$), and Social ($Index$) into a dimensionless $0-1$ scale.
2.  **Calculate Metric:** Compute $V$ for each system.
3.  **Plot Together:** Can we fit them all on a single "Universal Stability Curve"?
4.  **Proof:** If they align, UET is a **Universal Law of Complexity**.

## 4. Expected Outcome
A single "U-Shape" or "Hill" curve where optimal function happens at the peak, and failure happens at the extremes.
