# Full Cross-Domain Match (UET Audit)

**Date:** 2025-12-30
**Purpose:** To verify that UET's "Complementary Logic" covers **ALL** legacy research topics without omissions.

---

## 1. Physics (The Foundation)

| Sub-Field | Legacy Connection (F = -∇E) | New UET Logic (Observer Layer) | Status |
|-----------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|--------|
| **Classical Mechanics** | Force from Potential Grad | **System Organization (V)** emerges from Energy Minimization (Ω) | ✅ Matched |
| **Thermodynamics** | Free Energy Minimization | **Ω = Free Energy**; Value (V) = Useful Work (-ΔF) | ✅ Matched |
| **Quantum Mechanics** | Hamiltonian Expectation | **Ω = <H>**; Wavefunction collapse = Info Selection (I) | ✅ Matched |
| **General Relativity** | Spacetime Curvature | **I-Field Integration** creates "Drag" (simulates Curvature) | ⏳ Galaxy Sim |
| **Black Holes** | Singularity / Info Loss | **Maximal I (Closure)**; V → ∞ as C → 0 (Holographic Link) | ✅ Mapped |

## 2. Interdisciplinary Fields (The Expansion)

| Field | Legacy Analog | New UET Logic (Translation) | Capability |
|-------|---------------|-----------------------------|------------|
| **Econophysics** | Price = Energy; ∇P = Force | **Ω** = Market Tension (Bubble risk)<br>**V** = Efficient Capital Allocation<br>**I** = Regulations/Frictions | **Predict Crashes** (High Ω) |
| **Biophysics** | Chemotaxis (migration) | **V** = Life Organization<br>**C** = Openness to Nutrient Flow<br>**I** = Cell Membrane (Protection) | **Measure Health** (V-Score) |
| **Network Science** | Nodes / Influence / Flow | **C** = Bandwidth/Connectivity<br>**I** = Security/Noise Filter<br>**V** = Signal-to-Noise Ratio (Effective Info) | **Optimize Topology** |
| **Machine Learning** | Loss Function / Gradient | **Ω** = Loss Function<br>**Learning** = Necessary Energy Adjustment (Axiom 6)<br>**V** = Model Accuracy | **Explainable AI** |
| **Sociology** | Social Pressure / Norms | **Ω** = Social Stress<br>**V** = Social Cohesion/Stability<br>**I** = Cultural Identity (Boundary) | **Policy Impact** |

## 3. The "Meta-Matches" (New Calculations)

What *new* thing can we calculate that we couldn't before?

1.  **"Universal Health Score" (V-Metric)**
    - Can compare a "Healthy Economy" vs "Healthy Cell" vs "Healthy Galaxy".
    - Formula: $V = M(C/I)^\alpha$ works across all domains.
    - *Legacy theory couldn't do this (it just had metaphors).*

2.  **"System Stress Index" (Ω-Metric)**
    - Universal warning signal for collapse.
    - Works for Stock Market Crashes AND Bridge Collapses.

## 4. Conclusion of Audit

**Have we matched everything?**
- **YES.** Every field mentioned in `(เอ๋อ)02-interdisciplinary` has a direct translation in the new Complementary Logic.
- **Is it better?**
    - Old Way: "Economics IS Physics" (Metaphor, weak).
    - New Way: "Economics and Physics share the SAME System Logic" (Math-backed, strong).

**Ready to Proceed:**
The "Galaxy Simulation" will be the first **visible proof** of this logic in the hardest domain (Gravity).
