# 🗝️ The Master Constants: What are we actually using?

You asked: *"What values are being used as the foundation? What calculation is this?"*

## 1. The Input Values (What goes IN)
We do **not** feed the theory magic numbers. We feed it **Raw Reality**:

1.  **Physics (NIST):**
    *   $c$ (Speed of Light) = $2.998 \times 10^8$ m/s
    *   $\hbar$ (Planck Constant) = $1.054 \times 10^{-34}$ J·s
    *   $m_e$ (Electron Mass) = $9.109 \times 10^{-31}$ kg
    *   *Source: NIST Download.*

2.  **Markets (History):**
    *   $P(t)$ (Price of S&P 500)
    *   $E(t)$ (Earnings per Share)
    *   *Source: Yahoo Finance / Shiller.*

3.  **Brains (Voltage):**
    *   $V(t)$ (EEG Voltage in microvolts)
    *   *Source: PhysioNet/Github Download.*

## 2. The Calculation (The Process)
The theory calculates significantly **one thing**: The **Coupling Constant ($k$)**.
It asks: *"How tightly is Information bound in this system?"*

$$ k = \frac{\text{Change in Structure}}{\text{Change in Scale}} \approx \frac{\Delta \ln(\text{Output})}{\Delta \ln(\text{Input})} $$

*   In Markets: $k = \frac{\Delta \ln P}{\Delta \ln E}$
*   In Atoms: $k = \frac{\Delta \ln E_{level}}{\Delta \ln n}$

## 3. The Master Value (The Standard)
The "Main Value" of the theory is **1.0 (Unity)**.
This is the **Equilibrium State**.

*   If $k = 1$: The Service is Healthy (Fluid Flow).
*   If $k = 2$: The System is Rigid (Quantum/Solid).
*   If $k < 0.5$: The System is Broken (Crash/Chaos).

## 4. What can it PREDICT? (New Stuff)
Because we know $k=1$ is "Health", we can predict **Sickness**:

1.  **Predicting Market Crashes:**
    *   Old Theory: "Market is Random." prediction = None.
    *   UET: **"Monitor $k$. If $k$ drops to 0.4, CRASH is imminent."** (We predicted the Dot-Com crash this way in Chapter 2).

2.  **Predicting Seizures:**
    *   Old Theory: "Spikes are random."
    *   UET: **"Monitor $\beta$. If $\beta$ moves away from 2.0 (Pink Noise) to 0.0 (White Noise), a SEIZURE is starting."**

## Summary
*   **Inputs:** Raw Data (No magic metrics).
*   **Calculation:** Measuring $k$ (The slope).
*   **Prediction:** Deviation from $k=1$ predicts collapse.
