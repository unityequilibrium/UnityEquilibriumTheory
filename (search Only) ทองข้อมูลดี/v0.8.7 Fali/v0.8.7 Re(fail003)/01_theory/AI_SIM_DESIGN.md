# 🤖 AI Simulation Design: Intelligence as Energy

**Goal:** Map Neural Network Optimization (Loss Descent) to UET Energy Minimization ($\Omega$).

## 1. The Core Variables
UET maps AI dynamics to Thermodynamic Energy Landscapes:

| Physics/UET | AI Mapping | Logic |
|---|---|---|
| **Potential Energy ($\Omega$)** | **Loss Function** | High Loss = High Stress/Error (System wants to minimize this). |
| **Temperature ($T$)** | **Learning Rate** | High LR = High Exploration/Chaos. |
| **Phase Transition** | **Grokking** | Sudden structural organization (Energy Collapse). |
| **Value (V)** | **Generalization** | Usefulness on unseen data (Validation Accuracy). |

## 2. The Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:** "Learning" is a **Thermodynamic Cooling Process**.
- **Early Phase:** High Temperature (High LR), exploring the landscape.
- **Cooling Phase:** $T$ drops, system settles into a local minimum.
- **Grokking:** A "Phase Transition" where the system discovers a deeper, more efficient energy basin (Sudden drop in $\Omega$).

## 3. The UET Formula
We propose an "Optimization Efficiency Metrics":
$$ \text{Dissipation Rate} = -\frac{d\Omega}{dt} $$
(How fast is the system turning Chaos into Order?)
- **High Dissipation:** Rapid learning.
- **Zero Dissipation:** Stagnation/Convergence.

## 4. The Experiment
1.  **Load:** `research_v3/01_data/llm_training.csv`.
2.  **Calculate:** Energy ($\Omega$) and Dissipation Rate.
3.  **Detect:** The "Grokking Event" (Step 7000) as a massive spike in Dissipation Efficiency.
4.  **Visualize:** Loss Curve annotated with UET Phase Transitions.

## 5. Success Criteria
- The model must identify Step 7000 as a "Critical Phase Transition".
- It should show that Intelligence correlates with minimal $\Omega$.
