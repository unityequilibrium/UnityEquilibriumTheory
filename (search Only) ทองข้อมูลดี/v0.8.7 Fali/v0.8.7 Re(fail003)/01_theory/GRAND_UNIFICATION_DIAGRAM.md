**User Request:** "Show me how EVERYTHING connects."
**Answer:** This diagram maps the **Standard Physics** world to the **UET Information** layer.

## 2. The Logic Flow (How it works)

1.  **Physics Exists (Blue):** We don't touch it. $F=ma$ is still true.
2.  **UET Observes (Orange):** We measure the "Information State" of the physics.
    *   **Ω (Omega):** How stressed is the system? (Energy Potential)
    *   **I (Closure):** How isolated is it? (Creates "Drag" or "Identity")
    *   **C (Openness):** How much does it interact?
    *   **V (Value):** What useful order comes out?
3.  **Phenomena Emerge (Green):**
    *   In **Galaxies**, high `I` (Closure) creates "Drag" $\rightarrow$ **Dark Matter**.
    *   In **Economics**, low `V` despite high activity $\rightarrow$ **Bubble**.
    *   In **Biology**, balanced `C/I` $\rightarrow$ **Life**.

## 3. Why It Looks "Simple" (The Iceberg)
The diagram looks clean because we **abstracted the complexity**.
- **Before:** UET tried to *be* Newton + Einstein + Thermo (Messy, Conflicted).
- **Now:** UET *sits on top* of them as a unifying language.

**Analogy:**
- Physics is the **Hardware** (CPU, RAM).
- UET is the **Operating System** (Windows).
- You don't need to rebuild the CPU to write Windows. You just need to manage it.
