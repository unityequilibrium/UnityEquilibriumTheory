# UET Variables: Precise Definitions

**Date:** 2025-12-30
**Purpose:** Define each UET variable with units, meaning, and physics connection

---

## 🔴 Rule: These definitions must NOT conflict with existing physics

---

## Variable 1: 𝒞 (Communication / Openness)

### Definition:
```
𝒞 = Rate of exchange/interaction between system and environment
```

### Units:
```
[𝒞] = 1/time  (e.g., Hz, s⁻¹)
or
[𝒞] = dimensionless ratio (0 to 1)
```

### Range:
```
𝒞 = 0 → completely closed system (no exchange)
𝒞 = 1 → completely open system (maximum exchange)
```

### Physics Connection (USES, not replaces):
```
𝒞 relates to: d_eS/dt (entropy FLOW through boundaries)
From thermo: dS = d_eS + d_iS
UET adds:    d_eS ∝ 𝒞 (higher 𝒞 = more entropy exchange)
```

### NOT to be confused with:
- ❌ c (speed of light) - different variable!
- ❌ Consciousness - not what we mean
- ❌ Capacitance - different domain

## Variable 2: ℐ (Insulation / Closure)

### Definition:
```
ℐ = Degree of isolation / friction / resistance to exchange
```

### Units:
```
[ℐ] = 1/time  (inverse rate)
or
[ℐ] = dimensionless ratio (0 to 1)
```

### Range:
```
ℐ = 0 → no isolation (fully open)
ℐ = 1 → complete isolation (closed system)
```

### Physics Connection (USES, not replaces):
```
ℐ relates to: d_iS/dt (entropy PRODUCTION inside)
From thermo: d_iS/dt ≥ 0 always (2nd law)
UET adds:    d_iS ∝ ℐ (higher ℐ = more internal dissipation)
```

### Relationship with 𝒞:
```
Often: 𝒞 + ℐ = constant
or: 𝒞 and ℐ are competing factors
```

### NOT to be confused with:
- ❌ Instinct - not what we mean
- ❌ Current (I) - different variable!
- ❌ Identity - not symbolic

---

## Variable 3: 𝒱 (Value / Outcome)

### Definition:
```
𝒱 = Measurable outcome of system dynamics
𝒱 = "Useful result" after accounting for costs
```

### Formula (from UET):
```
𝒱 = M(𝒞/ℐ)^α

where:
- M = scaling factor (context-dependent)
- α = exponent (determines sensitivity)
```

### Units:
```
[𝒱] = same as whatever outcome is measured
Could be: energy, utility, fitness, productivity
```

### Physics Connection (USES, not replaces):
```
𝒱 relates to: "useful work" concept in thermodynamics
Thermo says: W = ∫F·dx (work done)
UET adds:    How "valuable" is this work for system organization?
```

### Key Property:
```
𝒱 ↑ when 𝒞/ℐ ↑ (more open = more value, typically)
𝒱 can be measured in each domain differently
```

### NOT to be confused with:
- ❌ Voltage (V) - different domain!
- ❌ Volume (V) - different domain!
- ❌ Potential V(x) - different meaning!

## Variable 4: Ω (Balance / Disequilibrium)

### Definition:
```
Ω = Measure of system's distance from equilibrium
Ω = "Tension" or "potential" that drives system dynamics
```

### Units:
```
[Ω] = energy (Joules) or dimensionless
```

### Range:
```
Ω high → far from equilibrium (unstable, potential for change)
Ω low → near equilibrium (stable, less potential)
```

### Key Relationship with 𝒱:
```
𝒱 ≈ -ΔΩ

Meaning: Value = reduction in disequilibrium
When Ω decreases, value is created
```

### Physics Connection (USES, not replaces):
```
Ω is LIKE: Free energy (G or F in thermo)
          Hamiltonian expectation ⟨H⟩ in quantum
          Loss function in optimization

Thermo says: Systems minimize free energy
UET adds:    Ω tracks this process, 𝒱 measures progress
```

### NOT to be confused with:
- ❌ ω (angular velocity) - different variable!
- ❌ Ohms (Ω) - resistance unit, different context

## Summary Table

| Variable | Meaning | Units | Physics Analog | NOT |
|----------|---------|-------|----------------|-----|
| 𝒞 | Openness/exchange | 1/s or [0,1] | d_eS/dt | c, consciousness |
| ℐ | Closure/friction | 1/s or [0,1] | d_iS/dt | I (current), instinct |
| 𝒱 | Value/outcome | context | useful work | V (voltage) |
| Ω | Disequilibrium | J or [-] | free energy | ω (angular) |

2. ✅ Check: Does ℐ contradict any physics? NO
3. ✅ Check: Does 𝒱 contradict any physics? NO
4. ✅ Check: Does Ω contradict any physics? NO
5. ✅ Check: Do relationships obey thermodynamics? YES
