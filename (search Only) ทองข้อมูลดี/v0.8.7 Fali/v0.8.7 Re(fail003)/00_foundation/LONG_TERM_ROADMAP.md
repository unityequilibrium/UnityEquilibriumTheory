# 🗺️ Long Term Roadmap: The Lighthouse Strategy

## Phase 1-23: The Foundation (Completed) ✅
*   We proved the math ($k=1$).
*   We proved the connection (Quantum-Neuro-Finance).
*   We identified the trap (Entropy/Debt).

## Phase 24: The Lighthouse (Current) 🕯️
You realized that "We can't force a closed world to open."
Other systems (Nations, Banks) will resist. They will stay closed until they collapse from their own Entropy.

**Our Strategy:**
1.  **Be the Open System:** UET must be 100% Open Source. No secrets. No "Black Box".
2.  **Wait for the Crash:** When the "Closed Systems" (Debt-based economies) hit the Entropy Wall (Vicious Cycle), they will look for an alternative.
3.  **Provide the Protocol:** UET will be there, ready to serve as the new Operating System for a balanced world.

## Future Milestones
- [ ] **Publish the Code:** GitHub/GitLab (Done locally).
- [ ] **Automate the Watchdog:** Run `advanced_stress_test.py` daily to monitor Global $k$.
- [ ] **Teach the Language:** Translate "Money" into "Entropy" so people understand the cost of their actions.

**"We do not fight the dark. We just turn on the light."**
