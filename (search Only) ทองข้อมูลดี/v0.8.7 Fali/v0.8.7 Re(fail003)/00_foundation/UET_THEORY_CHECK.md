# 🧠 UET Theoretical Validation (User Review Required)

**Objective:** Validate UET logic with the original creator before proceeding.

## 1. Black Hole Growth Mechanism
**My Understanding:** UET predicts $M_{BH} \propto a^k$ ($k=2.8$). This coupling dominates in **Dead Ellipticals** because they lack accretion (food). In Quasars, accretion drowns out this signal.
**Question:** Does this align with your original derivation? Is "Dead Ellipticals" the correct target?

## 2. Market Value Metric
**My Understanding:** $V_{UET} = B \times \sqrt{\frac{B}{M}}$.
- Crash Condition: When Price $P$ rises significantly above Value $V$ (specifically $V < 0.85 P$).
**Question:** Is this threshold meaningful to your theory, or simply a heuristic? Should it be tighter?

## 3. Scope of Validation
**My Understanding:** We must validate using **Legacy Data Only** first to prove the original concept works.
**Question:** Are you satisfied with the `SP500_legacy.csv` test, or do you require specific additional legacy files to be recovered?
