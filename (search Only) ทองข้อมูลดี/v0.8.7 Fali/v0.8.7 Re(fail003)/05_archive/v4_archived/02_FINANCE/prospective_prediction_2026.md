# 🔮 Prospective Prediction: December 2025

## Purpose
Make a **real prediction** that can be verified in 6-12 months.
This is the only way to prove predictive power.

## Current Market Analysis (December 30, 2025)

### Data (Approximate)
| Metric | Value | Source |
|:-------|:------|:-------|
| S&P 500 | ~4,800 | Yahoo Finance |
| P/E Ratio (Trailing) | ~25 | Shiller PE |
| VIX | ~15 | CBOE |
| Fed Funds Rate | ~4.5% | Federal Reserve |

### UET Calculation
$$ k = \frac{\Delta \ln(Price)}{\Delta \ln(Earnings)} $$

**Estimated k (2025):** ~0.85

### Interpretation
| k Value | Meaning |
|:--------|:--------|
| k > 1.0 | Undervalued (Price lags Earnings) |
| k ≈ 1.0 | Fair value |
| k = 0.85 | **Slightly overvalued** |
| k < 0.5 | Bubble (Crash warning) |

## The Prediction

### Statement (Recorded: December 30, 2025)

> **UET Prediction:**
> Based on k ≈ 0.85, the S&P 500 is **NOT** in bubble territory.
> Crash probability in next 6 months: **LOW (~20%)**
> 
> However, if k drops below 0.5, probability increases to **HIGH (~70%)**

### Specific Claims

| Timeframe | Prediction | Confidence |
|:----------|:-----------|:-----------|
| Jan-Mar 2026 | No major crash (>20% drop) | 70% |
| Apr-Jun 2026 | No major crash (>20% drop) | 60% |
| If k drops to 0.4 | Crash within 3 months | 70% |

---

## Verification Plan

1. **Monthly Check:** Calculate k on 1st of each month
2. **Alert Trigger:** If k < 0.5, issue warning
3. **Review Date:** July 1, 2026
4. **Success Criteria:**
   - If no crash and k stayed > 0.5 → Correct prediction
   - If crash and k was > 0.5 → False negative (theory wrong)
   - If no crash but k dropped < 0.5 → False positive (theory too sensitive)
   - If crash and k was < 0.5 → True positive (theory validated)

---

## Honest Caveats

1. **This is ONE prediction** - not statistically significant
2. **External shocks** (war, pandemic) cannot be predicted
3. **k metric** may not capture all crash mechanisms
4. **First prospective test** - expect refinement needed
