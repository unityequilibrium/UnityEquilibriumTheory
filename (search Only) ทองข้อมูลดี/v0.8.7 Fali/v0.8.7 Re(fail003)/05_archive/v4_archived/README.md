## 🎯 Scope (Honest & Limited)

This version of UET focuses on **2 domains only**:

| Domain | Question | Prediction Type |
|:-------|:---------|:----------------|
| **Physics** | Can UET predict galaxy rotation curves without dark matter? | Quantitative ($km/s$) |
| **Finance** | Can UET predict market crashes before they happen? | Time-based ($Date$) |

**We do NOT claim to explain:** Biology, AI, Sociology, Consciousness, MBTI, or anything not listed above.

## 📊 Core Elements

| Item | Count | Status |
|:-----|:------|:-------|
| Variables | 4 (C, I, V, Ω) | Defined with **units** |
| Axioms | 5 | Testable & Independent |
| Equations | 3 | **Derived** (not postulated) |

## ⚠️ Honest Limitations

1. **This is a proposal**, not proven science.
2. **Tests may fail.** We will report failures honestly.
3. **Peer review pending.** No external validation yet.

## 📚 How to Read

1. Start with `00_CORE/variables.md` → Understand what C, I, V mean.
2. Read `00_CORE/axioms.md` → The 5 core principles.
3. Read `00_CORE/equations.md` → The math derivations.
4. Pick a domain (`01_PHYSICS/` or `02_FINANCE/`) → See predictions & tests.
